# Theano Short Demo

Purpose of this repo is to demonstrate the fundamentals of Theano. The codes in this repo aims to be clear and contructed from the bottom.

## Dependency
* __Theano (numpy)__: Of course you need `Theano`. To install it, follow the instruction [here](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html). `numpy` will be installed alongside.
* __h5py__: We use HDF5 data format to save and load the datasets. In some demos, you need `h5py` package. You can install it by `pip install h5py` but in case you get some errors and you are using Ubuntu, (I don't know why exactly) you may try `apt-get install python-h5py`.
